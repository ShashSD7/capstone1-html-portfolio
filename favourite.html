        <h2><u>FOOTBALL</u></h2>
        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
            Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
            is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and
            Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
            football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to
            varying extent common origins and are known as "football codes".

            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
            parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
            games at English public schools during the 19th century.The expansion and cultural influence of the
            British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
            controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
            Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in
            order to maintain their heritage.In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first
            of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
            football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>

        <h2><u>CRICKET</u></h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running
            between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from
            leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means
            of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
            fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting
            a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have
            been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by
            a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who
            record the match's statistical information.</p>
